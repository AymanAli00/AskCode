My iPad 4 mini issue

Hello!

My iPad 4 mini stays on the apple logo for a while and restarts again and again and doesn't launch to the home screen as usual!!

Could anyone help me fix it?


the issue with your iPad seems unusual!
have you tried to jailbreak it before. I am asking that question because jailbreaking the iPad the wrong way causes this issue.
if yes, the only solution is to reinstall the iPad software. Visit the following link to know how to do that.
